# Listings
An android app that connects to the Google books API which would allow a user to get a list of published books on a given topic


This project is about combining various ideas and skills Iâ€™ve been practicing throughout the Udacity Android developer nanodegree course. They include:

1. Fetching data from an API

2. Using an AsyncTask

3. Parsing a JSON response

4. Creating a list based on that data and displaying it to the user.
